How does SingleCellFusion work?
================================
SingleCellFusion is built around the idea that for a cell profiled by a given omics technique (RNA-sequencing,
snATAC-sequencing, snmC-sequencing) there are unobserved features of that cell that if sampled would
provide a fuller picture of that cell's identity. For example, if a cell underwent RNA-sequencing we know
what genes are expressed but we don't know the patterns of DNA methylation in that same cell. The methylation
status of DNA in that cell is unobserved, limiting our ability to fully understand the identity of that cell.

In an ideal world we would obtain the transcriptome, methylome, and chromatin accessibility of a single
cell at once, but as the technologies for this type of experiment develop SingleCellFusion can provide a
computational equivalent. SingleCellFusion uses known relationships between different types of multiomics
data to impute unobserved data, enabling the multimodal analysis of a cell's identity.

The core of SingleCellFusion is the generation of a nearest neighbors graph between different data sets.
This graph is generated by finding nearest neighbors using the correlation of counts at highly variable
features. For example, DNA methylation is known to be negatively correlated with gene expression. If a
snmC-seq profiled cell has low methylation at a number of highly variable genes, and a snRNA-seq profiled
cell has high gene expression at those same genes, we can assume that those two cells likely belong to the
same cell type. We use this nearest neighbors graph to generate imputed counts by averaging among a cell's
neighbors in the opposite modality. The actions of SingleCellFusion depend on the type of nearest neighbor
graph specified, and are described below.

Direct mutual nearest neighbors
-------------------------------

In this method, highly variable features are identified in each data set. On a cell-to-cell basis the
correlation of counts at highly variable features is calculated. These correlation values are used
as the distance metric for identifying mutual neighbors.

Once the correlation is calculated, neighbors across modalities are determined. We require that
each neighbor has to have high correlation between each other. In other words, a snmC-seq profiled
cell can only be a neighbor with a scRNA-seq cell if the methylation levels at the highly variable
features are strongly anti-correlated with gene expression at those same features in the scRNA-seq
profiled cell, and vice versa. This ensures that only strong neighbors are found and that the
nearest neighbors graph is not dominated by noisy or spurious correlations.

Once the neighbors graph is generated imputed counts are generated by the following equation:

For cell *j* in modality *m* which has direct mutual nearest neighbors with cells in modality
*m*, the imputed *m'* counts for feature *f* are given by the average over its *k* nearest
neighbors in modality *m'*.

This is the most conservative method for generating imputed counts, only cells that make direct mutual
nearest neighbors will receive imputed data. This method typically leads to good integration but can
result in the loss of large fractions of cells from the analysis if mutual neighbors were not found for them.


Mutual nearest neighbors with rescue
-------------------------------------

As with the direct method, the distances between two pairs of cells is their correlation at
highly variable genes. The only difference with this method is that in addition to a mutual
nearest neighbors graph between modalities, a mutual nearest neighbor graph within each modality
is also generated. This within modality graph allows for imputation to be performed on all cells, by
using the within modality neighbors to determine what the best matched neighbors are across
modalities.

For a cell *l* in modality *m*, which has no direct mutual neighbors with cells in modality
*m'*, the imputed *m'* counts for feature *f* are given by a weighted average over its *k*
nearest neighbors in modality *m* which have direct mutual neighbors with cells in modality
*m'*. The cells with direct mutual nearest neighbors have imputed counts per the equation in
"Direct mutual nearest neighbors:"

The weights *A(l,j)* are determined by the distance between *l* and *j*, *d(l,j)* by the following
equation:

This is a more lenient method for generating imputed counts as all cells will receive imputed
data. This method will enable all cells to be analyzed.

k-nearest neighbors
-------------------

Similar to the other methods, the distance metric between two pairs of cells is the correlation at
highly variable features. The major difference with this method is that each cell is required to make
*k* neighbors in the opposite modality, with the restriction that a cell in the opposite modality is
restricted to only making a set *j* number of neighbors. The maximum number of neighbors that a cell
in the opposite modality can make is given by the equation:

.. image:: n_neighbors_knn.png
  :width: 200
  :alt: equation 1 of knn

where *j* is the maximum number of neighbors a cell in modality *m'* can make, *k* is the required
number of nearest neighbors per cell in modality *m*, and *n*\ :sub:`m`\  is the number of cells in
modality *m*, and *n*\ :sub:`m'`\  is the number of cells in modality *m'*. *z* is a relaxation
parameter to restrict cells from becoming hyperconnected. The neighbor graph is created by randomly 
iterating through each cell and finding its k nearest neighbors that are below the maximumn cell
threshold. Once the nearest neighbors graph is generated imputed counts are generated by the same 
equation as in "Direct mutual nearest neighbors:

This is the most lenient method for generating imputed counts, as all cells will make neighbors
in the opposite data set.
